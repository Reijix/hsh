# hsh
A small shell written in haskell.

## Some TODOs
- [ ] quotes ("") should group a string on the commandline, parser needs to be adjusted for this
- [ ] arrow keys are not implemented yet, neither left/right for moving nor up/down for history, this also needs adjusting of the parser
- [ ] stdin and stdout should be reroutable with >> and <<
- [ ] handle unix signals (ctrl + c)
- [ ] command 'nuke <pid>' that kills a process
